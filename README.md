This is a crappy little project that i used as a learning project for selenium and sqlalchemy. It runs a headless youtube browser that plays music. I guess it could be useful for trying to learn selenium or a basic sqlachemy boiler plate. lol I am always trying to think of something to work on. They aren't allways the best ideas but practice makes perfect.
